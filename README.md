# cura-siemensnx-plugin
Cura Plugin that integrates with Siemens NX.

This plug-in will install integration with Cura into your Siemens NX installation. No changes are made to Cura itself, but Siemens NX gets a new menu option to print the object with Cura. This option launches Cura or (if it's already open) loads the model into Cura.
